   <p>The recent seminar led by the Red Cross was an eye-opening experience that provided valuable insights into the organization's mission, the realities of hazards and disasters in the Philippines, and essential life-saving lessons. </p>
   <br>
   <p>One of the most important topics discussed was the different hazards and disasters that frequently affect the Philippines. Given our country’s vulnerability to typhoons, earthquakes, and floods, understanding these risks is vital. This discussion heightened my awareness of the importance of disaster preparedness, not just on a national scale but also within our communities and households</p>

   <p>The seminar also featured a hands-on activity that was both educational and engaging. We were divided into four groups and rotated through four different stations, each focused on a specific emergency response technique</p>
   <br>
   <p>These skills are not just theoretical; they have real-life applications that can make a significant difference in emergencies. For instance, knowing how to perform CPR could mean saving a loved one who drowned.</p>

   <p>Overall, this seminar was an enriching experience that not only deepened my understanding of the Red Cross but also equipped me with essential life-saving skills. It taught me that preparedness, awareness, and quick response are crucial in times of emergencies. More importantly, it inspired me to share this knowledge with others, emphasizing the importance of first-aid training for the safety and well-being of our communities. Moving forward, I am looking to improve these ‘skills that make a difference’, ensuring that I can step up when it matters most. After all, saving lives doesn’t require a cape—just knowledge, preparedness, and a heart willing to help.</p>
